<p>However, in vivo artificial insemination (AI) is contraindicated for women with blocked fallopian tubes. Tubal patency should be demonstrated prior to the procedure of in vivo insemination. 
Tubal patency is usually done with an x-ray study, Hysterosalpingogram (HSG), or Fallopian Tube Patency Test (Rubin Test).
If there is a blockage of fallopian tube, then in vitro fertilization (IVF) with ICSI is a good option.
If a patient with azoospermia (no sperm production in ejaculate semen), or extremely low sperm density, or very sluggish spermatozoa,
then IVF with ICSI can be indicated, and a good success rate will be expected.
The in vivo artificial insemination provides a relatively less chance of success in older women, who are over 40 years old, 
or in younger women whose Day 3 FSH level is markedly elevated or who presents with significantly reduced ovarian reserve.</p>
