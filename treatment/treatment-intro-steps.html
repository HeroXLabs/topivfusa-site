<h3 id="baseline-test">Baseline Test</h3>

<p>Most IVF cycles start at the time of women’s menstrual period. There are three steps in the process of IVF treatment cycle that will be adjusted according to patient’s condition, and can be individualized based on the needs of patient. For a successful IVF treatment cycle, it is crucial that the patient follows these steps and directions carefully. Any mistake could jeopardize the success of the IVF treatment</p>

<p>Office visit is scheduled on the Day 2 or Day 3 following the onset of menstruation for the purpose of abaseline ultrasound examination of pelvic organs, and a blood test usually for the determinations ofFollicle Stimulating Hormone (FSH) and Estradiol (E2). Other tests such as screening of infectious diseases (e.g., HIV, Hepatitis B, Hepatitis C, etc.) may be repeated if they are done more than 6 months.</p>

<h3 id="ovarian-suppression">Ovarian Suppression</h3>

<ol>
  <li>Generally it takes about 2 - 4 (or 3 - 5) weeks for ovarian suppression.</li>
  <li>Oral contraceptives (birth control pills) can start to help ovarian suppression. Oral contraceptives can be continued for 2 - 4 (or 3 - 5) weeks. By giving the patient on birth control pills, doctor is able to control patient’s menstrual cycle and make it predictable. This will in no way harm the patient’s chances of conceiving.</li>
  <li>During the use of oral contraceptives, or overlapping with the use of oral contraceptives, Lupron is then initiated simultaneously about 2 weeks before the start of ovarian stimulation. Approximately 4 days before the last birth control pill, patient starts Lupron subcutaneous injection (under the skin) with a small needle daily; Lupron will suppress the pituitary-ovarian axis; in other words, it will put the ovaries in “sleep”.Lupron is used to complete the pre-stimulation ovarian suppression, so that doctor can control the ovarian function with fertility medications. If Lupron is not taken, there is a significant risk that the oocytes may be released before eggs can be ready to pick up (retrieve).The average process of down-regulation with Lupron takes about 10-12 days (or 2 weeks) to achieve the ovarian suppression. For this reason, Lupron is begun about 14 to 17 days before the anticipated start of ovarian stimulation. At the end of this time, another office visit is scheduled. A transvaginal ultrasound and blood test for Estradiol (E2) level will be performed to confirm that down-regulation and ovarian suppression has been achieved. The level of Estradiol (E2) that is considered a successful ovarian suppression varies slightly from patient to patient. Generally the plasma Estradiol (E2) level should be at 50 pg/mL or lower.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="ovarian-stimulation">Ovarian Stimulation</h3>

<ol>
  <li>Generally it takes about 8-12 (or 10-14) days for ovarian stimulation.</li>
  <li>Ovarian stimulation is started with injectable fertility medications on the day that is determined by doctor under the situation of ovarian suppression. Fertility medications will stimulate the ovaries to produce multiple eggs. The response to these drugs varies according to the patient’s age, FSH hormone levels, the size of the ovaries, and the amount of drugs given. Lupron is continued at a lower dose and a precise dosage of fertility medications (e.g., Follistim, Gonal-F, Menopur, Bravelle, Repronex or a combination of these medicines) per day is begun.</li>
  <li>These medicines are given once (usually in the evening) or twice daily (morning and evening). The patient will be told when to stop taking these medicines. If the patient stops taking these medications prematurely, it might lead to the cancellation of the cycle.</li>
  <li>These drugs are usually taken for 8-12 (or 10-14) days. Some patients might need a longer period of time to have a successful stimulation. It is particularly common in older patients or women with elevated FSH levels.</li>
  <li>Since doctor may need to change the dose of medication based on patient’s response during the day, it is convenient if the patient take her injections in the evening.</li>
  <li>A vaginal ultrasound examination will be performed 4-5 days after the start of these medications.</li>
  <li>Ganirelix Acetate Injection: Some patients will receive Ganirelix Acetate Injection instead ofLupron. Both of them play the same role, which prevents the ovary from premature ovulation. However,Ganirelix Acetate Injection is given after the initiation of ovarian stimulation when the lead follicle is 12-14 mm in diameter. Ganirelix Acetate Injection is given every night for about 3-5 days. It is extremely critical to take the Ganirelix Acetate Injection every night until patient is told to stop by doctor. Failure to do so may result in premature release of the eggs and cancellation of the IVF cycle.</li>
  <li>Additional Medications: Often patients may be placed on Dexamethasone and Baby Aspirin. These drugs are also started on the same day when fertility medicines are started.</li>
  <li>Additional Medications: Some women with elevated prolactin levels will be given Parlodel orDostinex. Further instructions will be given to the patient as to when to continue or discontinue these medications.</li>
  <li>Additional Medications: Folic acid is an important vitamin that every patient attempting to conceive should take for 2-3 months prior to conception. It has been shown to reduce the incidence of serious birth defects, particularly neural tube defects (NTDs) such as spina bifida.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="step2-fertilizationicsiahpgd">Step2. Fertilization/ICSI/AH/PGD</h2>

<h3 id="semen-collection">Semen Collection</h3>

<ol>
  <li>It is performed on the day of egg retrieval.</li>
  <li>Semen is obtained from the male partner on the same day after egg retrieval, typically about 11:00 AM-12:00 noon. The semen is then prepared to inseminate the eggs 3-4 hours later.</li>
  <li>If the male partner needs to undergo a testicular biopsy for sperm recovery, he will be in the operating room and doctor will perform the needle biopsy under local anesthesia. This procedure will usually last 15-30 minutes and the patient will be discharged home with an ice pack placed over the testicles to prevent swelling.</li>
  <li>In about 50% of cases, an additional specimen is obtained 48 hours prior to follicle aspiration, or on the day of HCG administration.</li>
  <li>Occasionally, a final specimen may be requested in the morning after egg retrieval, if fertilization is sub-optimal and embryologists have reason to believe that an additional sperm specimen would be adequate.</li>
  <li>In order to optimize sperm quality, it is best to abstain from sexual activity (ejaculation) for 3 to 7 days prior to semen collection. In most cases, abstinence will be planned after the 7th day of woman’s fertility medications.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="sperm-selection">Sperm Selection</h3>

<p>Once semen sample is obtained by masturbation after 3 day’s abstinence, the ejaculate is then collected in a sterile container supplied by the Center. This container is non-toxic to spermatozoa. Once semen sample is collected, it is then forwarded to the laboratory as soon as possible. Several tests measure sperm parameters, e.g., volume of ejaculate, pH and viscosity of semen, density of spermatozoa, motility grading and patterns, morphology, contents of white blood cell (WBC), pus cell, red blood cell (RBC), microbiology, and sperm antibodies, etc. Accordingly, different sperm preparation method may be applied to different quality of semen sample. However, for the betterment of mother and fetus, the American Fertility Center (also known as American Test Tube Baby Center) will apply one of its great inventions,“The Wang Tube Real-Time Sperm Micro-Separation Technology” for husband’s sperm selection for your couple’s fertility therapy. You will be proud of that.</p>

<p>In certain special conditions of male sterility in which no spermatozoa can be collected from the ejaculate, it is often possible to collect spermatozoa from the male ducts (ductus deferens and epididymis) or organs from the testes (testicular biopsy) by surgery. Sperm retrieval is done in surgical room. However, such a situation will be discussed at consultation; preoperative studies for male partner will be done in advance.</p>

<h2 id="step3-embryo-transfersupportfrozen-follow-from-intro-steps">Step3. Embryo Transfer/Support/Frozen (follow from intro steps)</h2>

<h3 id="embryo-transfer">Embryo Transfer</h3>

<ol>
  <li>Embryo transfer is performed about 3 - 5 days after egg retrieval whereas zygote tubal transfer is conducted within 24-48 hours of follicle aspiration.</li>
  <li>Patient will be asked to arrive in Clinic 30 minutes prior to embryo transfer. About 30 minutes before embryos transfer, doctor will meet the couple and discuss the number and quality of the embryos at that time. A decision will be made by the couple and doctor regarding the number of embryos that will be transferred, and the number to be frozen or discarded. After discussion, patient will be taken to operating room for the preparation of embryo transfer. This is similar to the procedure of an artificial intra-uterine insemination except that embryos are transferred to the uterus instead of sperm sample. The embryos will be separated into a separate dish and then transferred to a transfer catheter. A speculum is inserted in the vagina and then the cervix is washed and cleansed with normal saline. The embryologist will then deliver the catheter containing embryos to the physician who introduces the catheter via the cervical canal into the uterine cavity where the embryos are released on the endometrium. The embryologist will then check the catheter to make sure none of the embryos remains in the catheter. The whole procedure takes approximately15 minutes. The patient will remain in a supine position on bed for about 30 minutes afterwards.</li>
  <li>Embryo transfer is a simple procedure, which does not require anesthesia, but patient may be given sedative (e.g., valium) to help relaxing the muscles. It is important that each patient should have someone to drive her home after the procedure. It is recommended that the patient rests at home for 1 or 2 days following embryos transfer.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="instructions-after-et">Instructions After ET</h3>

<ol>
  <li>On the day of embryos transfer, patient should go directly home or to the hotel patient has stayed and rest for 1-2 days. You can use the restroom but do not shower. You may have some watery discharge. This is from the vaginal wash but not because of embryos coming out.</li>
  <li>The day after embryos transfer, patient may resume light normal activities. It is suggested that patient rests for 1-2 days.</li>
  <li>Do not lift heavy material. Do not intercourse. Do not perform high impact activities. Do not do strenuous exercise.</li>
  <li>Please follow the instructions for post-transfer medications.</li>
  <li>Call us if you have a fever greater than 101º F or 38º C</li>
  <li>Please call us for any questions at Toll Free No. (877) 592-3456.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="luteal-phase-support">Luteal Phase Support</h3>

<ol>
  <li>Luteal phase support generally starts on the day of embryo transfer.</li>
  <li>The first progesterone suppository is placed in the vagina at the time of embryo transfer. Thereafter, patients are asked to use the suppositories twice a day until the end of the first trimester of pregnancy, or when the second blood test for pregnancy is negative.</li>
  <li>Some doctors may also start patient on progesterone injections or suppositories on the day of HCG injection to prepare the uterine lining for implantation.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="acupuncturechinese-medicine">Acupuncture/Chinese Medicine</h3>

<p>Dr. Wang is a two (2) licensed physician and surgeon, and acupuncturist and herbalist. There are very few doctors who have two (2) medical licenses in the United States. This clinic will corporate the western medicine and Asian medicine including the Chinese acupuncture and medicinal plants together to help our infertility couples before, during, and/or after embryo transfer. It is an integrated treatment that has been found to be greatly beneficial to fertility therapy, e.g. increasing the sperm density and motility, enhancing ovulation function, and improving pregnancy rate following artificial insemination and/or IVF procedure.</p>

<h3 id="excess-embryo-cryopreservation">Excess Embryo Cryopreservation</h3>

<p>Any viable embryos in excess of those transferred back to the patient’s uterus may be frozen.</p>

<h3 id="pregnancy-test">Pregnancy Test</h3>

<ol>
  <li>Pregnancy test can be done on Day 14 and Day 21 after egg retrieval.</li>
  <li>Two pregnancy tests are typically performed, i.e., blood is drawn in the morning on Day 9 and again on Day 12 following transfer. Doctor will contact you with the result, which is typically available in the afternoon of that day.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="complications-of-ivf">Complications of IVF</h3>

  <li>Complications during fertilization are rare and less than 3% of treatment cycles. Nevertheless, early detection and early treatment for any possible complications always favors a rapid recovery.</li>
  <li>Post-operative complications: These complications may include (1) bleeding of ovary: 4 out of 1500 cycles, or about 0.2%; (2) ovarian torsion: 2 out of 1500 cycles, or about 0.1%; (3) gynecological infection: 5 out of 1500 cycles, or about 0.3%.
Clinical manifestations are considerable abdominal pain, malaise, digestion complaints, bouts of fever, etc. Symptoms generally occur in a few hours following oocyte retrieval (before being discharged home), but infection usually occurs 2 to 3 days later.</li>
</ol>

<p>The most frequent complication is “Ovarian Hyper-Stimulation Syndrome”. The incidence of “Ovarian Hyper-Stimulation Syndrome” is estimated 18 out of 1500 cycles, or about 1.2%. This syndrome is generally observed 5 days after oocyte retrieval.</p>

<p>Following the medical stimulation of ovaries and/or ovulation induction, the size of ovary may increase at the second part of treatment cycle, or immediately after oocytes retrieval. However, this phenomenon can be looked as a normal response. However, in certain women, or for some reasons not yet understood, the ovaries may become abnormally large and abdominal fluid appears in the abdomen. Patient may appear abdominal pain, abdominal swelling, general malaise, sometimes accompanied with nausea, vomiting. Sudden weight gain is common secondary water retention. Regardless the low rate of complications, please inform us when you have any symptom or feel uncomfortable, our team will take the appropriate measures for you.</p>
